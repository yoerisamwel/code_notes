# Import the TextBlob class from the textblob library, which is used for processing textual data.
from textblob import TextBlob

# Create a TextBlob object with a string that contains misspelled words.
blob = TextBlob("I havv a guud ideea")

# Perform spelling correction using the correct method of the TextBlob object.
# This method will automatically correct the misspelled words in the TextBlob.
corrected_blob = blob.correct()

# Print the original text and the corrected text to compare them.
print("Original Text:", blob)
print("Corrected Text:", corrected_blob)

# The expected output will show the original string with misspellings, and then the corrected string.
# Output:
# Original Text: I havv a guud ideea
# Corrected Text: I have a good idea

# Use case: This script can be useful in applications such as word processors, form input validation,
# or any text-based application where spelling accuracy is important.

# Note: To use this code, ensure that the textblob library is installed in your Python environment.
# You can install it using pip with the command: pip install textblob. You may also need to download
# additional resources for textblob to work correctly. This can usually be done by executing
# `textblob.download_corpora()` after installation.
