# Secure File Handling:

Secure file handling is crucial when dealing with sensitive information to prevent unauthorized recovery of deleted files.

Use cases:

1. Deleting Sensitive Information: When sensitive data, such as personal information or confidential documents, must be permanently removed from a storage device.
   Example: A company disposing of financial records must ensure the data cannot be recovered.

2. Data Sanitization: Before disposing of, repurposing, or donating storage devices, it's important to sanitize the media to prevent data leaks.
   Example: An IT department securely wipes all drives in decommissioned machines before recycling them.

3. Regulatory Compliance: Certain industries are legally required to handle data securely, including the deletion process, to comply with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR.
   Example: A healthcare provider must securely delete patient records when they are no longer needed.

4. Secure Application Logs Management: Applications that handle logs containing sensitive information should securely delete them after use.
   Example: A web application deletes logs containing user IPs and other PII after analyzing them for security threats.

The provided code demonstrates a method of secure file deletion. It opens a file, overwrites it with random data to prevent data recovery, and then deletes the file from the file system. This is a basic implementation and there are more robust methods available for highly sensitive data.
