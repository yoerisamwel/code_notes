# Import the pyautogui library which allows you to control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications.
import pyautogui

# Use moveTo function to move the mouse to the absolute coordinates (x=100, y=100) on the screen.
# Use case: This can be useful when you need to automate the process of clicking a static button or a point on the screen.
pyautogui.moveTo(100, 100)

# Use moveRel function to move the mouse to a position that is relative to its current position.
# In this case, it moves 50 pixels to the right and 25 pixels down from wherever the mouse currently is.
# Use case: This can be helpful for tasks that require the mouse to move a certain distance from its current position, such as dragging items or navigating menus that don't have fixed positions.
pyautogui.moveRel(50, 25)

# The hashtag at the start of this line is used to write comments in Python.
# Comments are not executed as code and are used to explain what the code is doing, making it easier for others to understand.
# The specific hashtagged text in the image seems to refer to a website for coding, likely where more information or tutorials on pyautogui can be found.

# Importing the pyautogui module which allows automation of mouse and keyboard operations.
import pyautogui

# The click() function simulates a mouse click. PyAutoGUI defaults to the left mouse button.
# Use case: This function can be used to click on buttons, links, or any clickable elements on the screen.
pyautogui.click()

# Again, importing the pyautogui module.
import pyautogui

# The click() function with 'clicks' and 'interval' parameters.
# 'clicks=3' means it will simulate three mouse clicks instead of one.
# 'interval=1' sets the number of seconds between each click to 1.
# Use case: This can be used for situations where multiple clicks are needed with a delay between them, such as during installations or when navigating through a slideshow.
pyautogui.click(clicks=3, interval=1)

# The hashtag indicates a comment, which is not executed as code.
# It appears to refer to a website related to coding, possibly the source of this Python snippet or where additional resources could be found.

# Import the pyautogui library for GUI automation with Python.
import pyautogui

# Use the scroll function to scroll the mouse wheel. The number (100) represents the amount to scroll.
# Positive numbers will scroll up, and negative numbers will scroll down.
# Use case: This function is helpful for navigating through long web pages or documents.
pyautogui.scroll(100)

# Typing text with pyautogui.
import pyautogui

# The typewrite function simulates typing the text string provided as an argument.
# Use case: It can be used to automate typing into text fields, search boxes, or any text input areas.
pyautogui.typewrite('Hello, world!')

# Typing text with an interval between each keystroke.
import pyautogui

# Here, the typewrite function also includes an interval parameter.
# 'interval=0.5' means there will be a 0.5 second delay after each key is pressed.
# Use case: This simulates a more human-like typing and can be useful where rapid typing might cause issues, such as in certain applications that expect input at a natural typing speed.
pyautogui.typewrite('Hello, world!', interval=0.5)

# As with the other code blocks, the hashtagged text at the end seems to be a reference to the source or related resource.
