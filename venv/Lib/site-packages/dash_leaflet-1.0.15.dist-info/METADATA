# Dash Leaflet

Dash Leaflet is a light wrapper around React-Leaflet. The syntax is similar to other Dash components, with naming conventions following the React-Leaflet API.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to install the latest version of Dash and Dash Leaflet via pip.

```
pip install dash
pip install dash-leaflet
```

Once the installation is completed, paste the following lines of code into a .py file and run it.

````
from dash import Dash
import dash_leaflet as dl

app = Dash()
app.layout = dl.Map(dl.TileLayer(), style={'height': '50vh'}, center=[56, 10], zoom=6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server()
````

That's it! If you visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser, you should see a Leaflet map.
