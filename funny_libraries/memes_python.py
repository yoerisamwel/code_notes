'''
The emoji library is a handy tool for working with emoji in Python, 
allowing you to easily add a touch of personality and visual interest 
to text output in applications. It can convert emoji shortcodes to their 
corresponding emoji characters, as well as perform the reverse conversion, 
among other things.
