# code_notes
I made this repo to store code concepts and code snippets that I found interesting or use a lot and I want to be able to quickly refence for projects.

SQL code examples.sql
I added these SQl snippets as I find I use these the most. 

Plotly folder
Added several graph designs I find usefull and plan to use in the future.

Funnel area chart

A funnel area chart is useful for visualizing the sequential reduction of data points through stages in a process, ideal for analyzing conversion rates and identifying bottlenecks in sales or operational workflows.

Icicle chart

An icicle chart is suited for displaying hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts or product categories, providing a clear visualization of the relationships between different levels of data.

Pie chart

A pie chart, especially when configured as a doughnut chart with a hole in the center, is effective for showing the proportions of categories within a whole, making it useful for comparing parts of a dataset in a visually appealing way.

Sunburst chart

A sunburst chart is used to represent hierarchical data with multiple levels in a circular layout, useful for understanding the composition of a dataset at a glance and exploring relationships between parts and the whole.

Treemap chart

A treemap chart visualizes hierarchical data using nested rectangles, allowing for efficient use of space to display large amounts of data, making it ideal for comparing proportions and understanding the distribution of categories within a dataset.


ARIMA Folder

I created this folder to store the python code for the ARIMA model I explored for calculating the rolling average used in time series analysis.
