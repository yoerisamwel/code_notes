'''
The Seaborn library's violin swarm plot is a combination of a violin plot and a swarm plot. 
This type of visualization is used to show the distribution of quantitative data across different 
categories and to display all individual observations along with the underlying distribution.

Use cases:

1. Data Exploration: Quickly understand the distribution of variables and look for outliers.
   Example: Exploring the distribution of customer wait times in different branches of a bank.

2. Presenting Results: Visually compelling way to present the distribution and individual data points
   for small to medium-sized datasets.
   Example: Presenting test scores of students in a class, highlighting individual performances.

3. Comparing Groups: Useful for comparing the distribution across several categories.
   Example: Showing the range and distribution of product prices across multiple stores.

The below code generates a simple violin swarm plot:

# Generate random data to simulate a distribution, here a normal distribution.
data = np.random.randn(100)  # Normally distributed data

# Create a violin swarm plot
# The violin plot shows the distribution of the data.
sns.violinplot(data=data, inner=None, color='lightgray')  # No inner annotations in the violin plot

# The swarm plot shows each individual data point.
sns.swarmplot(data=data, color='blue', alpha=0.5)  # The alpha sets the transparency of the points

# Title for the plot
plt.title('Violin Swarm Plot Example')  # Sets the title of the plot

# Display the plot
plt.show()  # Shows the plot
